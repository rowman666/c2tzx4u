c2tzx4u
=======

This is a port of c2tzx to UNIX-like operating systems.

Requirements
------------

To build c2tzx4u and the example code:
  - C compiler
  - BSD make

To cross compile C code into a tzx using c2tzx4u:
  - SDCC (Small Device C compiler)
  - objcopy (should come with your binutils install)

Building c2tzx4u
----------------

  $ cd src && make

Testing c2tzx4u
---------------

Example code is provided for minimal testing:

  $ cd examples/test && make

You can then load up the tzx file in an emulator such as fuse:

  $ fuse test.tzx

License
-------

The code is derived from c2tzx for windows. This project can be found here:
https://code.google.com/p/c2tzx/

Apparently this is GPLv2 code, so we will roll with that.
